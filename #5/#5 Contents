You are tasked with creating an Employee Management System that can handle
different types of employees.
You need to create an Interface called Employee. In this Interface, you should declare
two methods, String getRole() and double calculateSalary().
Create 3 separate classes, namely FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee and
ContractEmployee. Each of these classes should implement the Employee Interface. Each
class should provide its specific implementation for calculateSalary() based on the employeeâ€™s
role, and getRole() to return the role of the employee.
In the main class, use a list of Employee references to store objects of different types.
Each object in the array will be treated as an Employee, but when you call calculateSalary()
on each employee, Java will dynamically dispatch the correct version of calculateSalary()
based on the actual object type.
Initialize objects like below:
employees[0] = new FullTimeEmployee(50000); // Full-time employee with a salary
of 50,000
employees[1] = new PartTimeEmployee(20, 120); // Part-time employee with hourly rate
20 and 120 hours worked
employees[2] = new ContractEmployee(30000); // Contract employee with a contract
amount of 30,000
Such that the output is:
Role: Full-Time Employee
Salary: 50000.0
Role: Part-Time Employee
Salary: 2400.0
Role: Contract Employee
Salary: 30000.0
