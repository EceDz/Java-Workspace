Below, you can find the description of your labwork for today. You can also find the
expected output of this code in the Application Walkthrough section.
You are going to improve your Blockbuster DVDs Shop system on top of the previous
weekâ€™s labwork.
You are going to create a DVDRental class, that includes the following variables:
Variable Name Type
customer Customer
movieName String
duration int
To achieve this goal, it's necessary to implement constructor overloading within your
DVDRental class. In simpler terms, you should create two constructors: one with two
parameters (customer and movieName), and another with three parameters (customer,
movieName, and duration). By default, the rental duration will be set to 7 days. If a longer
rental period is required, you can provide this information when using the three-parameter
constructor.
You should implement a menu as below;
1. Enter Customer
2. Display All Customers
2. Rent a movie
3. Rent a movie (custom duration)
4. Display all rentals
0. Exit
Hint 1: Create another array to store DVDRental objects.
Hint 2. When creating DVDRental objects, you should search the Customer array to find a
customer with a given id at the 2nd and 3rd menu options.
