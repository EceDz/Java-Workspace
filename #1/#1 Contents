Below, you can find the description of your labwork for today. You can also check the
expected output of this code in the Application Walkthrough section.
You are required to develop a rental system for the Blockbuster Media Shop. For the first
week, you are going to build a simple system that displays information about the customers in
a loop as follows;
1. Enter Customer
2. Display All Customers
0. Exit
For this purpose, you will create a Customer class that includes id, name, surname, age,
postCode, and email variables. It will also have a displayInfo() method to display the
information about the Customer.
When the user selects the 1st option, a new Customer object should be created and this
object should be stored in an array. If the 2nd option is selected, all stored customer
information should be printed on the screen.
PS: You can use basic C-style arrays.
