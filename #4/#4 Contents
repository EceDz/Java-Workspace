you are required to convert a C-style array to an ArrayList. You will
start with the following, given array:
Integer[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
You first need to convert this array into an ArrayList. Then, use an Iterator to traverse
through the ArrayList and print each number. Your code will NOT be graded if you don’t use
Iterator.
Provide a menu to the user with the following options:
1- Add a Number
2 - Remove a Number
3 - Print Existing Number List
4 - Exit
You should use an Iterator to traverse and print the list after every modification. The
program should continue showing the menu until the user selects Exit.
