You will implement a Pets hierarchy. You'll create an Pet superclass with
subclasses for Dog and Cat. Additionally, Cat will have a subclass Kitten.
In the table above, the fields marked with “+” are attributes while the fields marked with “-”
are methods. displayInfo() methods should return information regarding the respective class.
For instance, in the Pet class, the displayInfo() should return the name, age and the price of
the Pet object. Furthermore, for the Kitten class, displayInfo() method should be overridden
such that it will return name, age, color, isIndoor and isHealthy fields.
The other methods’ implementation should be as follows:
public void fetch(){
System.out. println(“The dog is fetching the ball!”);
}
public void scratch(){
System.out.println(“The cat is scratching the furniture!”);
}
public void play(){
System.out. println(“The kitten is playing!);
}
