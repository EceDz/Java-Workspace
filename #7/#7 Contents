You are tasked with developing a program that simulates basic e-commerce
operations: you are required to design a program that simulates an order placement system
with constraints on order quantity and size.
Requirements:
Place an Order: The user enters the product name and quantity they wish to order.
Validation Rules:
Quantities must be greater than 0.
Orders larger than a certain threshold (e.g., 1,000 items) are not allowed.
If any rule is violated, the program throws and handles an exception.
Custom Exceptions:
InvalidQuantityException: Thrown if the quantity is less than or equal to 0.
OrderLimitExceededException: Thrown if the order exceeds the allowed
size limit.
